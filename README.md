# CUDA Checker

Quick CUDA checker to check CUDA functionality. It checks things that commonly went wrong when I was trying to install a specific CUDA version to run some older code.

You (obviously) need PyTorch with a working CUDA version to run the script without errors: https://pytorch.org/

To run the script activate your environment and run:

```python3 check.py```
